Here is what we found out while comparing the LDA and PCA

When we applied the PCA to the dataset for cars, we noticed a huge cluster that contains
3 different classes stacked on top of each other. It seems very hard to distinguish which is which.
That should be a common thing for PCA because it foucs on finding the max variance within the data and
it doesnt take the labels into account. It treats the dataset as a whole.

When using LDA, the clutering was still present, but wasnt as bad as PCA. LDA tries to find the most 
variance between classes while taking labeling into account. 
Because of this we can somewhat see the seperation better compared with PCA.
